		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hello, this is me playing around with websites. I'm using this to play around with the things I've learned about HTML and Javascript. Before I jump into integrating Javascript, I want to see if I'm able to create a decent outline for a webstite and then see where I go from there.</p>
